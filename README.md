## Excel_Kickstarter_Analysis


### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to help Louise understand how other campaigns succeeded in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. By utilizing the provide data for over 4,000 campaigns, a few observations could be extrapolated about the campaign’s outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes

The data collected for the Kickstarter shows the there is a correlation between the success of the campaign and their launch date. During the spring (March- May) there is an increase in the campaign’s success, followed by with a steady decline through the Summer (June- September). The data suggests if a campaign were to launch during the months of spring, their likelihood of success would increase.

When looking at the success of the campaigns between 2009 and 2017, there was a gradual increase from 2009 to 2012. During the years of 2016 and 2017 there was a sharp decrease in their success. It’s unclear as to what factors could have led to the decrease in success and total of campaigns.

Based on the data provided, the categories will likely meet their funding goal if their goal is less than $4,999. Around 73-76% of those who had a goal less than $4,999 had obtained a pledge either meeting or exceeding their expectation.  While the goals between $35,000 and $44,999 also had a great success rate, the sample for those 2 ranges were incredibly minute totaling 9 campaigns. 

The most successful category was music, which had a 77% success rate, followed by theater and film/video. After complete analysis of the data, the ideal campaign would fall under the music category, have a goal less than $4,999 and launch during the spring. These are the factors that would lead to the highest rate of success.

### Limitations and Challenges

A limitation that could impact the data would be a lack of other geographical representation in the Kickstarter campaigns. There are 21 countries represented in the collected data, with 2 countries representing 90% of the data. Nearly 75% of the campaigns are in the US followed by Great Britain, representing about 15% of the data. Due to having a small samples size in a majority of the countries their failures and successes could be a reason the data is so skewed. If you were to view the data for Switzerland (CH) they have a single campaign in theater which was successful. Due to the lack of data, one cannot say with confidence that theater (plays) would be successful in Switzerland. In comparison to the US 
Many outside factors could have an influence in the success or failure of a campaign. Some of those factors include culture, religion, pandemics, location (rural or urban) and so forth. These factors aren’t taken into account, since the sample pool was so limited. 

Another limitation would be the currencies used, since it’s unclear whether or not the currency is uniform. The value of the money varies in each country: the US Dollar ($1.00) compared to that of the British Pound (£0.78). While the difference seems minute the difference is significant especially in larger quantities. If the company (American based) were to pledge a British campaign $500, which is their goal they didn’t meet their goal. If the conversion was done, the campaign was pledged £389.42, therefor the campaign would fail. 


### Tables and Graphs

A suggested graph or table would be further analysis of the backers of the campaigns, since they are important to the success of the campaigns. A possible table or graph could be the category vs pledge and backers count vs category. A graph further exporting backers count vs category would help understand which category would be favored. 


The other suggestion would be a table or graph showing the category vs pledge to understand how much each category obtained. The graph would be able to show how much funding each category received, with filters on their outcome.
